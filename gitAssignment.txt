Perform the following scenario involving Git. Divide yourselves in pairs and perform the following tasks.

1. Sam and Jack are working together on a shared project MY_PROJECT that is stored in a remote Git repository. Jack performs a clone on the remote repository. What 2 things does Git create when Jack issues the git clone command?

Answer : git clone : it will create a local repository in local system

After this, Jack edits a file in the project MY_PROJECT called myfile.py. Then, he does a commit and a push. What does Git do when Jack issues these commands?

Answer:
add:  adds it to the index (marked to indicate ready to commit)
commit: saved the changes to the local repo
push: push the changes to the remote repo

Next, Sam does a clone on MY_PROJECT. Then, Sam and Jack both edit myfile.py simultaneously. The file myfile.py has over 200 lines of code. Sam edits a couple lines at the top of the file, and Jack edits a couple lines at the bottom of the file. Then, Jack does a commit and a push. Finally, Sam does a commit and a push. What does Git do when Sam issues the push command?

Answer:
push command fired by sam will say: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally.


What Git commands should Sam issue next and what would the result of these commands be?
pull
add
commit
push


2. Consider a Git repository (“repo”) with one commit and one branch (master). A user makes a new commit to the repo. Draw a box-and-line diagram of the repo like the diagrams shown in class. Include all commit nodes (with made-up hashes), all HEAD nodes, and all branch nodes.

3. Continuing the previous scenario, the user creates and checks out a new branch “my-branch” and then makes a new commit. Update the previous diagram to reflect these actions.
